// There's a great war between the even and odd numbers. Many numbers already lost their lives in this war and it's your task to 
// end this. You have to determine which group sums larger: the evens, or the odds. The larger group wins.

// Create a function that takes an array of integers, sums the even and odd numbers separately, then returns the difference between 
// the sum of the even and odd numbers.

// Examples
// warOfNumbers([2, 8, 7, 5]) âžž 2
// 2 + 8 = 10
// 7 + 5 = 12
// 12 is larger than 10
// So we return 12 - 10 = 2
